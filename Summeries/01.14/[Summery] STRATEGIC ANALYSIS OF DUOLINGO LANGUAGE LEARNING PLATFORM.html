<h2 id="research-methodology">1. Research Methodology</h2>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52627041949_eb2bdae7df_o.png" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<h2 id="characteristic-of-duolingo-company">2. Characteristic of Duolingo company</h2>
<ul>
<li>Was founded in 2012 by Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Luis von Ahn and his PhD student Severin Hacker.</li>
<li>Is accessible via Web and a mobile app.</li>
<li>Has 3 types of accounts: free, Duolingo Plus, and Duolingo for Schools.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="financial-resources">2.1. Financial Resources:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Digital language learning generates $6 billion in revenue, and that number is projected to rise to 8.7 billion USD by 2025 (Adams, 2019)</li>
<li>Revenue from language learning has grown 34–66% annually from 2016 till 2020 (see Figure 2).<br>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52626801666_7d9a32c2f9_o.png" alt="Figure 2"></li>

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52626803081_fc5ebf7984_o.png" alt=""></li>
<li>While the gross margin since 2019 exceeds 70%, currently the company is not making a profit. In 2021 this was largely due to the costs associated with the IPO (Duolingo, 2021).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="duolingo’s-competition">2.2. Duolingo’s competition:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In terms of app downloads, Duolingo clearly outperforms its competitors (see Figure 4).<br>

</ul>
<h2 id="swot-analysis-of-duolingo-language-learning-platform">3. SWOT analysis of Duolingo language learning platform</h2>
<h3 id="strengths">3.1. Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selection of languages</strong>: As of Feb 2022, Duolingo offers 40 Languages like :
<ul>
<li>Popular foreign languages: English, French, …</li>
<li>Endangered languages: Hawaiian and Navajo languages, …</li>
<li>Fictional languages: High Valyrian from Game of Thrones, and Klingon from Star Trek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gamification</strong>: According to L. von Ahn, Duolingo user retention level is comparable to that of games rather than learning platforms (Adams, 2019), Because as the users learn they :
<ul>
<li>Unlock higher levels.</li>
<li>Earn points for exercise, and rewards for achievements.</li>
<li>Compete in leaderboards.</li>
<li>Win virtual currency that can be used to purchase additional services.</li>
<li>Display their statistics and achievements on their profiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Freemium model</strong>: Users have access to the required services to learn for free. And for an additional fee, they can get extra lessons, ability to skip levels, and unlimited hearts, …</li>
<li><strong>Crowdsourcing</strong>: During lessons, all users can offer alternative translations. Crowdsourcing and ad-supported content are the reasons why the company can grant free access to the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Intuitive, simple, and immersive design</strong>: The app is :
<ul>
<li>Visually appealing.</li>
<li>User-friendly.</li>
<li>Users can follow their friends, and the active discussion forum.</li>
<li>Lessons are digested into very short sessions of 3-7 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical skills and innovation</strong>: Machine learning algorithm are used to record and analyzes user actions and adapts the app to their habits:
<ul>
<li>A reminder is sent at a time when the user is normally practicing.</li>
<li>The company collects huge amounts of data on users habits and needs, an uses in to create appropriate rewards and incentives.</li>
<li>It also shares its research experience by writing and publishing scientific articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understanding and relating to the target audience</strong>: The app has become popular across demographics thanks to its humorous approach in sentences like “Whose robot ate my cake?”, and its account on social media portraying the mascot, owl Duo, as a passive aggressive persecutor.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency and collaboration with universities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>2012 study of the Spanish course showed that 34 hours of Duolingo lessons are equivalent to 1 semester at the university (Vesselinov &amp; Grego, 2012).</li>
<li>A 2014 study showed that Duolingo English language Test (DET) scores directly correlate with the TOEFL iBT standardized test scores (Ye, 2014).</li>
<li>As of February 2022, more than 3,000 universities, including Yale, Cornell, and Columbia, accept DET as a substitute for TOEFL (Duolingo, n.d.-c).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weaknesses">3.2 Weaknesses:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical defects</strong>: Software errors are common:
<ul>
<li>The voice recognition algorithm is rather inefficient.</li>
<li>Users have the ability to report bugs, but there is no way to contact technical support.</li>
<li>Technical issues are usually resolved by restarting or reinstalling the app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beginner / intermediate CEFR level content only</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Upon completion of the course, it is possible to reach an intermediate but not an advanced level.</li>
<li>The content can be repetitive.</li>
<li>Users must know at least one of Duolingo’s learning languages (Learning takes place by translating from one language to another).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>No dialog practice</strong>: There is no opportunity to develop speaking skills.</li>
<li><strong>Intrusive commercials</strong>:
<ul>
<li>On the website, the advertisement is displayed on the side, not intrusively.</li>
<li>On the app, it appears after each lesson.</li>
<li>Ads are not tailored to potential consumers.</li>
<li>No option to provide feedback on add relevance.</li>
<li>The paid subscription is aggressively advertised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Frivolous image</strong>: Since they use a different to learning than other platforms, Diolingo is sometimes criticized and ridiculed for its approach.</li>
<li><strong>User dishonesty</strong>: Some users cheat to get higher levels, this demotivates other learners, and shows the platform primarily as a game to be won at all cost, rather than a learning platform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opportunities">3.3 Opportunities:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing education technology and language learning industry</strong>: Duolingo revenue accounts for 2–3% of the language learning revenue. As the sector grows, they have to add more features and content to retain existing users and aquire others.</li>
<li><strong>Certified language tests</strong>: Diolingo English test is an alternative to TOEFL and IELTS. It is possible to do the same for the Spanish DELE, French DELF/DALF, …</li>
<li><strong>Artificial intelligence and chatbots</strong>: First chatbot was developed more than half a century ago (Huang et  al., 2022); the same algorithms could be introduced in speaking skills development.</li>
<li><strong>Single language learning</strong>: A native speaker of a less popular language would still not have the opportunity to learn. Modifying lessons to provide learning without a second language could reach more users.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion to other educational areas</strong>: Developing similar learning platforms for students, such as preparations for specific tests like SAT (a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States).</li>
<li><strong>Business customers</strong>: As an employee incentive, some corporations bought subscriptions to tutoring platforms during the Covid pandemic. They can also be offered a corporate Duolingo license.</li>
<li><strong>Remote learning and teaching</strong>: The market for educational technologies is growing, so does the popularity of teleworking and remote learning, especialy during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational institutions are looking for more effective ways of teaching, companies are looking for ways to train and involve employees.</li>
